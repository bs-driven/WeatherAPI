## MOTIVATION
  In this project I wanted to make a application that takes the user input location and display the current forecast and the forcast for the week. A button to the side that will show the previous inputs which will then display the forecast once again allowing the user to compare different places quickly

 ## Problems
  I guess my intial approach may have been my biggest issue I went for a table desgin in my head to start an went to produce a the desired information rathere then a card. reading through the doc at using it wasnt as diffcult as I had origanally figure it would be. I think desgining everything for the page after the functionlity is what im lacking I keep think too much I guess.

 ## What I Learned
  In this project I ws able to use something called class list which was a particular function i wasnt to familar with well i cant say i had used it before. I've heard about how code is set in particular order and it was really something that stood out to me in this project when trying to produce a card for and the classes and style to it so that you can have it the way you want.

  ## Standouts
  This a quick week long forecast for anyones use help plans a week of travel maybe even just you work week even check and see if its good day to go for a jog. This particular code display the use a Weather APi, the use of fetchs. The manpulation of the html in script
